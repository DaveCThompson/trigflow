# Education Strategy

Pedagogical approach for teaching trigonometry through Visual Trig.

## Core Philosophy

**Understanding over memorization.** Students should **see** why identities are true, not just memorize them. Visual proofs create lasting intuition that formulas alone cannot.

## Lesson Structure

### Progressive Disclosure

Each topic builds on previous knowledge:

1. **Unit Circle** → Foundation (radius = 1)
2. **Sin/Cos** → Coordinates on the circle
3. **Tan/Cot** → Ratios and tangent lines
4. **Sec/Csc** → Reciprocals and similar triangles
5. **Identities** → Relationships between functions

### Proof Pedagogy

For visual proofs, follow this sequence:

1. **Setup** - Show the complete configuration
2. **Highlight** - Draw attention to key relationships
3. **Transform** - Animate the proof step
4. **Reveal** - Show the conclusion
5. **Reinforce** - Display the equation

## The Rearrangement Proof

The Pythagorean theorem proof demonstrates the philosophy:

**Step 1**: "Here's a square with side (a+b) containing 4 triangles"
**Step 2**: "The remaining area is c²"
**Step 3**: "Same pieces, rearranged..."
**Step 4**: "Now we see a² + b²"
**Conclusion**: "Therefore a² + b² = c²"

The student **watches** the equation become true.

## Key Principles

### Show the "Why"

- Pythagorean identity: Show the right triangle ON the unit circle
- Tangent identity: Show similar triangles with the same ratios
- Reciprocals: Show 1/sin literally as the reciprocal length

### Interactivity

Let students explore:
- Drag the angle to see functions change
- Toggle functions on/off to reduce clutter
- Step through proofs at their own pace

### Estimation Before Calculation

The unit circle teaches geometric intuition:
- sin(30°) ≈ 0.5 (halfway up)
- cos(60°) ≈ 0.5 (halfway across)
- tan(45°) = 1 (45° line hits x=1 at y=1)

## Target Audience

- High school pre-calculus students
- College students reviewing fundamentals
- Self-learners seeking visual intuition
- Teachers needing demonstration tools
